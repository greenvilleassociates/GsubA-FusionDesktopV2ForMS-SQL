FUSION PRO IS A LICENSED SERVICE AND IS NOT A FREE SERVICE. BUT THE INSTALLER WILL GIVE YOU THIRTY DAY PRIVLEDGES TO PREVIEW THE SYSTEM

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
1) UBUNTU 16.04 LTS IS REQUESTED. SIMPLY BECAUSE ALMOST ALL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR IT ON THE INTERNET WORK WITHOUT MODIFICATION DUE TO THE HUGE INSTALL BASE
AND MATURE PATCHES FOR THIS PLATFORM. (UBUNTU HAS 10's OF MILLIONS OF MACHINES RUNNING NOW). LATER VERSIONS OF UBUNTU ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMPLICATED IN THAT
THEY PULL CONFIGURATION DATA FROM WEB REPOSITORIES. WE ARE NOT EXCLUDING THESE, BUT THE AVERAGE IT PERSON CANNOT WORK WITH ANYTHING HIGHER THAN 16.04 WITHOUT AT LEAST TWO
YEARS OF LINUX ADMINISTRATION AND A PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION.
2) FOLLOW MS-SQL INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR MS-SQL SERVER 2019 INCLUDING ALL PECL, AND UNIX COMMAND LINE OPTIONS. (SEE MICROSOFT.COM)
3) THIS IS DESIGNED FOR THE NGINX WEB SERVER, WITH A PROXY TO IIS ON A SECONDARY PLATFORM.
4) FUSION PRO MAKES USE OF NGINX AS A SCREAMING FAST WEB ENGINE AND MOST OF V3 IS STRAIGHT HTML OR IMAGES WHICH WE NEED TO DO AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.
5) SSO IS OPENSOURCE ON MS-SQL(JOOMLA) WHICH IS A DIFFICULT INSTALL WITHOUT US.
6) FUSION PRO REQUIRES ADOBE COLDFUSION SERVER 2018 OR HIGHER.
7) FUSION PRO IS A PREMIUM PRODUCT AND IS IN COMPARISON EXPENSIVE COMPARED TO V2. IT IS HOWEVER DESIGNED TO BE AN ENTERPRISE IT MANAGER FOR YOUR ENTIRE BUSINESS AND IS FULLY
8) INTEGRATED WITH MICROSOFT DYNAMICS.
9) MOST OPEN SOURCE TOOLS DO NOT WORK WITH MS-SQL AS AN OPTION WITHOUT MAJOR MODIFICATIONS, BUT THEORETICALLY WILL WORK IF PHP DRIVERS CAN BE PORTED.
10) ANY OPENSOURCE TOOL CAN BE PORTED TO FUSIONPRO ON MS-SQL THEN WITH ABOUT A 90-DAY WINDOW AS A CUSTOM DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.
